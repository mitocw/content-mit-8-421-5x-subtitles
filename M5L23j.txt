OK, so we have this result, which at least demystifies
what many people say.
Actually, I've heard truly experienced researchers
in the field to say we can do the transfer without ever
populating the excited state.
So the truth is what I just derived for you.
But now we want to compare it to what
would happen if you use an incoherent picture.
If you use an incoherent picture,
let's assume we would use a pi pulse,
put all the population in the excited state.
And then we would stimulate it down.
So we have a pi pulse.
So we build our population.
And then we use a second pi pulse.
Well, we would then have about unity population in the excited
state.
It would emit light at a rate gamma.
And it would take the time of the inverse Rabi
frequency, the Rabi period, to stimulate it down.
Now you can say, what happens if, maybe
that's dumb to have a pi pulse and put all the population in.
Take a pi over 20 pulse, put a little bit population
in, stimulate it down, the next batch, the next batch,
the next batch.
But you get exactly the same result.
Because each population which you have put into the excited
state had to wait for a Rabi period to be stimulated down.
So therefore, in the incoherent picture,
if you sort of transfer batches of population,
you realize that the probability for spontaneous emission,
or for populating a false state, is independent of the transfer
time.
Because it cancels out if you do small pieces of population.
You have a smaller rate of emission.
But you integrate for longer.
And the two temporal factors cancels out.
And now you realize that the coherent transfer
is more favorable by another power of omega Rabi times T
transfer in the denominator.
So that's why people prefer STIRAP.
Questions about that?

OK, can you suggest another method?
How we could transfer population from one state to the next?
I gave you two examples.
One was this magic, or not so magic, dark state transfer.
The other one is a method where we put populations, stimulate
it down, next batch of population, stimulate it down.
What is another process which we can do to transfer population?

Pardon?
Landau-Zener--
Landau-Zener-- actually, the STIRAP is a Landau-Zener.
The dark state is always the lower state.
There is a crossing, sort of, in between.
But it's an avoided crossing.
Actually, in a way, you may want to think about it.
The STIRAP is actually a Landau-Zener transfer
between where the lower state is the dark state.
The upper state is the bright state.
I still have a question.
So, Landau-Zener sweeps are great because you cannot know
exactly where your resonance is.
And you can robustly sweep populations
so long as you're close.
But this STIRAP scheme is sensitive
to the run-on incidence.
Absolutely it is.
How robust is it against small violations?
Qualitatively speaking.

Well, I gave you already the hint
when I discussed that if you are detuned from the Raman
resonance, this detuning, at the detuning frequency,
would beat note between dark and bright state.
So this picture, what is dark and what is bright,
is scrambled up by that.
So in other words, as long as your inverse detuning
is smaller than the transfer time, you're OK.
Because the dark state is the dark state.
But if during the transfer time, you turn the dark state
into bright state, you've completely
messed up the scheme.

So in other words, I know people in this hallway, in my group,
want to do STIRAP transfer between molecules.
And we have to stabilize our lasers.
So we have, automatically, little bit laser fluctuations.
But if you do the transfer in a millisecond,
it is sufficient to have the laser frequency under control
at the kilohertz level.
So that's a requirement.
But back to my question.
We have discussed sort of an incoherent transfer.
And we've discussed STIRAP.
Can you suggest another method how
you can go from one ground state to the next?

Can we talk about optical pumping?
Optical pumping-- yes.
But optical pumping means we really
go with spontaneous emission.
And then we have 100% spontaneous emission.
So we want a process where we go from one momentum state
to another momentum state.
But well-- what?
[INAUDIBLE]
Yes, optical pumping is a two-photon process.
Actually everything is a two-photon process here.
But optical pumping is actually a process
is where we have a Raman two-photon transition.
The first leg is stimulated.
The second one is spontaneous.
But I would suggest now, what [INAUDIBLE] said.
Let's have a two-photon Raman transition.
