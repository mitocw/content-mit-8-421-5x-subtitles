So, therefore, what this crucial here
is knowledge, or at least reproducibility, when you
of the phase phi.
And then you can get Nero lines.
So examples for techniques where you excite the system is T=0
and then you can do delayed detection or quantum beads.
I've mentioned earlier in the course the Ramsey spectroscopy,
where you've one Ramsey zone where you prepare your block
vector.
Then the block vector oscillates.
And if you simply look at the face angle of the block vector
after very long time, you have very high precision.
But, you're dealing with an exponentially small signal.
And another example of heterodyne or homodyne
techniques.
But you need something which is phase sensitive in order
to obtain sub-nature align bits.
The final comment is if you want to get
higher resolution with delayed detection, yes, you can get it.
But you lose exponentially in signal.
And what does it mean in practice?
Well, if you know your line shape,
you know it's well described by Lorentzian.
It is better to take your full signal
and use then an excellent signal to noise
to find the lines' center and split the line.
However, if there is any ambiguity,
there may be difficult, not fully resolved lines
under the Lorentzian and you don't
know how to split the line.
Then it may be better to do delayed detection action
and clearly see the structural of the lines
with sub-natural resolution.
