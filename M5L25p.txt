Well, that's the end of this course.
Let me thank you for your active participation.
Sometimes as a lecturer, you learn as much as the students.
And I think, partially based on your questions and discussions,
this is really true.
I've learned a few new aspects of atomic physics.
I hope you have learned something too --- and good luck in the future.
