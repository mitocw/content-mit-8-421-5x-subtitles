So we have a very simple solution.
We pump all the atoms into one quantum state
if you have only one of the laser beams.
But the question is now, can we have a similar situation
when both laser beams are on?

And what I mean by that is, is it possible
now to pump all the atoms into a state which does not
scatter any light, which does not
react with the light, which is never excited to the excited
state?
