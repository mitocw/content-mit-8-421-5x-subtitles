For the possible applications-- one
is you can design non-linear materials.
Usually, when you want to have frequency conversion processes
or optical switches that one laser beam effects
another laser beam, you want a very strong non-linear response
of your medium.
You usually get that if you go near resonance.
But near resonance you have strong absorption.
But now, using the concept of EIT, you can have both.
You can have the strong non-linear response
of your medium near resonance, but you suppress absorption.
You get a window of transparency using EIT.
So you can have near-resonant materials without absorption.
Again, in principle, I'm not aware
that this has really taken off in a bigger time.
One would be if you want to do very sensitive spectroscopy.
Assume you want to measure one isotope, which
has a tiny little abundance.
But you have to observe it against the background
of a very strong isotope.
If you could switch off the absorption of the background,
the absorption of the strong isotope,
you could still see a small amount of a trace isotope
in the presence of a strong absorption line.
So sensitive detection of trace elements.
