The question I have is: can you obtain with such a measurement
a spectral resolution which is narrower
then the natural alignments?
And well, we can give two possible answers.
And one is yes, because you're looking
at atoms which have survived for a long time so to speak.
These atoms are longer lived, or we've just
elected atoms which happened to survive for several lifetimes.

But then there should be sort of some lingering doubts,
if you have a sample which undergoes radioactive decay,
and you would go to your favorite supplier
and buy uranium which has already
decayed for a billion years.
It's the same uranium which existed a billion years ago,
and you will not be able to perform
any measurement on your well aged uranium
which has a higher resolution then if you had lived
a billion years ago and had done your measurement with younger
uranium.
So in other words, the exponential decay
is self-similar.
It starts at any moment, and it looks exponential
no matter where you start.

With which answer would you side: is it possible
or it's not possible?
